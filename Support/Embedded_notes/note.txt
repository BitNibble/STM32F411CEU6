NB:
Just Comment out in "stm32f4xx_it.c", the "void SysTick_Handler(void)" function definition, everything else will work.

After go to Project -> Properties -> C/C++ General -> Paths and Symbols
then link -> Includes
          -> Source Location

To generate hex files:
Project -> Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> MCU Post build outputs
then tick the box corresponding "Convert to Intel Hex file"

IDES, are just an abstraction to simplify coding in a logical and coherent manner, 
making it perceivable for man.

STM32F446RE (CMSIS dependencies tree)
-stm32f4xx.h
-stm32f446xx.h
-core_cm4.h
-system_stm32f4xx.h
-stdint.h

Settings:
Project -> Properties -> C/C++ General -> Paths and Symbols ...
Run -> Run Configurations â€¦

Try to reset the views by going to Window->Perspective->Reset Perspective. Then, Window-> Show view-> Console. This should be enough to resolve the issue.
